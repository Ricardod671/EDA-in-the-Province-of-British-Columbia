# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Oil Production in the Province of British Columbia

This project uses data from the [BC Energy Regulator](https://www.bc-er.ca/data-reports/data-centre/) to create a structured database in PostgreSQL. The data was transformed and cleaned using Power Query, and an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to extract insights related to oil production.

The database schema was designed to facilitate efficient analysis of production data across different wells. The final analysis was performed using SQL, and the results were visualized in Tableau.
